# REACT conversion
* set displayName on all components?
* inspect the app to make sure there are no unexpected re renders happening
* create a function that replaces switch() statements and creates reducer() functions

## TODO:
* add constructor into my classes and make their properties readonly (also implement reduxers)
* add comment to all files at the very top (before use strict)
* rename modules to camelCase and files to lowercase

### After done
* delete conversion_plan.md
* remove unused css and js
